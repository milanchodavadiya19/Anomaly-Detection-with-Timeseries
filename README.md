Anomaly detection using unsupervised learning

Here we will see about detecting anomalies with **time series forecasting**. Time series is any data which is associated with time(daily, hourly, monthly etc). For eg: revenue at a store every day is a time series data at a **day level**. Many use cases like **demand estimation, sales forecasting** is a typical time series forecasting problem which could be solved by algorithms like **SARIMA, LSTM, Holtwinters** etc. Time series forecasting helps us in preparing us for future needs by estimating them with the current data. Once we have the forecast we can use that data to detect anomalies on comparing them with actuals. Let's implement it and look at its pros and cons.
